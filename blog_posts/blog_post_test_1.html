    <h1>An Actual Post?</h1>
    <p>I've really been enjoying making this site! 
        Testing and re-resting is frustrating, but it's been rewarding!</p>
    <p>I'm unsure what this section is going to be. I don't have any actual authority over a subject
        so I'm not sure I can teach anyone anything.
        I think keeping a journal of my creative projects would be good.
    </p>
    <p>Currently I'm working on this site. I kind of got the Megaman NT Warrior vibe I was going for.
        I just need to work on the JS and CSS a bit more. Adding animations is going to be tough with 
        vanilla CSS. I'll figure it out though.
    </p>
    <p>I hope.</p>
